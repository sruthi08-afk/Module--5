# Exp.No:22  
## Destructor 

---

### AIM  
To create a Python class `Student` with a destructor. 

---

### ALGORITHM 

1. Begin the program.   
2. Define the `student` class.  
3. Inside the `student` class, define the `__init__` method (constructor) and the `__del__` method (destructor).  
4. Create an object `s1` of the `student` class. When the object `s1` is created, the `__init__` method is called, and its print statements are executed.  
5. Use the `del` statement to delete the object `s1`. This triggers the `__del__` method (destructor), and the respective print statements are executed.  
6. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
#Reg.NO 212223020026
#Name SRUTHI.K

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('Inside Constructor')
        self.name = name
        print('Object initialized')
    def show(self):
        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)
    def __del__(self):
        print("Inside destructor")
        print("Object destroyed")
s1 = Student('Emma')
s1.show()
del s1


```
